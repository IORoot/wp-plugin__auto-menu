# wp-plugin__auto-menu
Adds posts of a selected category to a menu automatically.

Cool little plugin that appears on the admin menu page. Allows you to select a post category and will automatically add any posts in that category to the menu.

Used on londonparkour.com for the wiki. Any posts in a specific category will be added straight to the sidebar menu.
